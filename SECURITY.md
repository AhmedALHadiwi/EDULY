# Security Documentation - EDULY Platform

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented in the EDULY educational platform to protect user data, prevent unauthorized access, and maintain system integrity.

## Authentication & Authorization

### Supabase Auth Integration
- **Email/Password Authentication**: Secure signup and login with strong password requirements
- **Email Verification**: Mandatory email confirmation before account activation
- **Password Reset**: Secure password reset flow with time-limited tokens
- **JWT Tokens**: Stateless authentication using Supabase-issued JWT tokens
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Student, Instructor, and Admin roles with appropriate permissions

### Security Measures
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents brute force attacks on auth endpoints
- **Account Lockout**: Temporary account suspension after multiple failed attempts
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with automatic expiration
- **CSRF Protection**: Cross-Site Request Forgery prevention
- **XSS Prevention**: Input sanitization and output encoding

## Database Security

### Row Level Security (RLS)
All database tables have RLS enabled with policies ensuring:
- Users can only access their own data
- Admins have elevated permissions for management functions
- Security logs are admin-only accessible
- Cross-user data access is prevented

### Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest**: All sensitive data encrypted in Supabase
- **Encryption in Transit**: HTTPS enforced for all communications
- **Input Validation**: Server-side validation for all user inputs
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries and input sanitization

## API Security

### Server-Side Protection
- **JWT Verification**: All protected endpoints verify Supabase tokens
- **Role Validation**: Endpoint-level role requirements
- **Rate Limiting**: Per-endpoint and per-user rate limits
- **Request Validation**: Input sanitization and validation
- **Error Handling**: Secure error responses without information leakage

### Security Headers
- **Helmet.js**: Comprehensive security headers
- **CORS**: Restricted to allowed domains only
- **CSP**: Content Security Policy prevents XSS attacks
- **HSTS**: HTTP Strict Transport Security enforced

## Monitoring & Alerting

### Security Event Logging
All security-relevant events are logged:
- Login attempts (successful and failed)
- Password changes and resets
- Role modifications
- Suspicious activity detection
- API access patterns

### Real-Time Monitoring
- **Failed Login Tracking**: Automatic account lockout after threshold
- **Suspicious Activity Detection**: Pattern recognition for potential attacks
- **Rate Limit Violations**: Monitoring for abuse attempts
- **Slack Alerts**: Real-time notifications for critical security events

## CI/CD Security Pipeline

### Automated Security Checks
Every code push triggers:
1. **Dependency Scanning**: `npm audit` for known vulnerabilities
2. **Secret Detection**: TruffleHog scans for exposed credentials
3. **Code Analysis**: ESLint security rules and type checking
4. **Build Security**: Verification that no secrets are in build output
5. **Auth Smoke Tests**: End-to-end authentication flow testing

### Deployment Security
- **Environment Isolation**: Separate configs for dev/staging/production
- **Secret Management**: GitHub Secrets and Bolt environment variables
- **Zero-Downtime Deployment**: Rolling updates with health checks
- **Post-Deployment Verification**: Automated security header checks

## Environment Variables

### Client-Safe Variables (VITE_ prefix)
```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
VITE_APP_URL=your_app_domain
```

### Server-Only Variables (Never exposed to client)
```bash
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_encryption_key
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=your_slack_webhook
```

## Security Best Practices

### Password Requirements
- Minimum 8 characters
- Must include uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character
- Maximum 128 characters to prevent DoS attacks
- Password strength indicator in UI

### Session Security
- Automatic session expiration (24 hours)
- Inactivity timeout (30 minutes)
- Secure session storage with integrity checks
- Multi-device session management

### Input Validation
- Client-side validation for UX
- Server-side validation for security
- Arabic name validation for localization
- Egyptian phone number format validation
- Email format validation with length limits

## Incident Response

### Security Event Classification
- **Info**: Normal operations (login, logout)
- **Warning**: Suspicious but not critical (rate limit hits)
- **Error**: Failed operations that might indicate attacks
- **Critical**: Confirmed security incidents requiring immediate attention

### Response Procedures
1. **Automated Response**: Account lockout, rate limiting
2. **Alert Generation**: Slack notifications for critical events
3. **Manual Investigation**: Admin dashboard for security log review
4. **Escalation**: Email alerts for persistent threats

## Compliance & Privacy

### Data Protection
- **GDPR Compliance**: User data rights and deletion capabilities
- **Data Minimization**: Only collect necessary user information
- **Consent Management**: Clear terms and privacy policy acceptance
- **Data Retention**: Automatic cleanup of old security logs

### Audit Trail
- Complete audit trail for all user actions
- Security event correlation and analysis
- Compliance reporting capabilities
- Data access logging

## Security Testing

### Automated Testing
- Authentication flow testing
- Authorization boundary testing
- Rate limiting verification
- RLS policy validation
- XSS and injection attempt simulation

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Password reset flow works correctly
- [ ] Email verification prevents unverified access
- [ ] Admin functions require proper authorization
- [ ] Rate limiting blocks excessive requests
- [ ] Security logs capture all relevant events
- [ ] Account lockout functions properly
- [ ] Session expiration works as expected

## Maintenance & Updates

### Regular Security Tasks
- **Weekly**: Review security logs for anomalies
- **Monthly**: Update dependencies and run security scans
- **Quarterly**: Rotate secrets and review access permissions
- **Annually**: Comprehensive security audit and penetration testing

### Emergency Procedures
- **Credential Compromise**: Immediate secret rotation process
- **Data Breach**: Incident response and user notification procedures
- **System Compromise**: Isolation and recovery procedures
